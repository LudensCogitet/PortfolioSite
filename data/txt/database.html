  I developed this database for a small private school in Delaware.
  This school is very big on teaching the students personal responsibility,
  and one of the ways it does it is by getting them involved in resolving disputes
  among themselves in an internal judicial process.

  The students aren't only involved in listening to testimony and interrogating witnesses,
  they're also in charge of making and keeping records, which is where my application comes in.
  It's designed to be run on a local server and accessed through a browser.
  It uses a mySQL database and PHP on the server side, with JavaScript and jQuery on the client.
  I also wrote a Python script to set up the proper database tables and users and to write a config file when setting up the server.

<p>
  One of the interesting requirements of this project was that I <b>not</b> make it as efficient as possible,
  because it isn't only a record keeping app, but a learning tool as well.
  I had to consult with the client to make sure we didn't make things so convenient that the students wouldn't learn anything!

  When looking at the live demo, feel free to sign in as <b>"user"</b> with password "user" or as <b>"admin"</b> with password "admin"
  and mess around with adding and modifying records. Besides the menu options in the top right, everything is accessed through contextual
  menus by clicking on column headings and individual cells. For instance, click on the "Case Number" to see a preview of information about that case. You'll
  also be given the option to update or modify the case, if you're signed in.

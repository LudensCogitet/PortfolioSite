I wrote this for a game jam with the theme of "words". My idea was
to make the text that appeared in the console very important to the player character's survival
by imposing serious limits on visibility and using the text to describe the sounds things made
while moving around the level (including the player character).

I only had whatever spare time I could find over the course of 2 weeks to get everything done,
and while I think the game itself was successful (at least in part), what really excites me about
this project is the future possibilities it has as a roguelike engine.

<p>
React's state-based nature and clear separation of concerns between visual and logical components
lends itself very well to roguelikes, and once I had a basic framework in place (a game world, a "camera" object
looking into that world, and a "screen" object displaying what the camera saw) it was easy to begin plugging
the other elements into place (game entities, map generation, pathfinding, ray-casting, etc.)

This was a collaborative effort with a friend of mine, who provided all the artwork.
There's a lot more to be done, but I'm excited to come back to this and expand it when I can.

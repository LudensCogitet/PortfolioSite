 For this Tic-Tac-Toe game I used the same kind of HTML5 canvas techniques I used for the Pomodoro timer 
 to give it some flair. The AI is a perfect player, which isn't hard to achieve. I also added a little variety in its opening moves as player two
 (when there's no strategic disadvantage), to make it seem a little more real.

 My favorite part of this project, though, was writing the text parser and printer script that allows for variable speed and delays
 in printing the AI's sassy dialogue.

<p>
 The system will queue blocks of text to print and use setTimeout to print at a given speed. Certain character
 combinations are used as signals to indicate when a delay or new line should appear. For example: "~500~N" means "wait 500 milliseconds and print a newline
 before continuing".

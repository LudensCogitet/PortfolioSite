  This is a simple Pomodoro timer used to measure work and rest periods,
  spiced up a bit with some HTML5 canvas animation. Since entering a 'flow' state
  can be so important to effective work, I thought it might help to remove as many
  left-brain activating distractions as possible (meaning numbers and other symbols)
  while still giving the user some notion of how much time had passed.

  The arc drawn of each circle is directly proportional to the portion that has passed
  of the interval it measures. The outermost circle is one second, the middle circle is
  one minute, and the innermost circle is one of the two periods set by the user.

  I also wanted this timer to be accurate, especially while running in a minimized browser window. So,
  rather than using something like setTimeout or setInterval, I regularly grab a current timestamp and compare
  it to a future timestamp. This way, even when the browser is using fewer resources to update the page, the timer catches
  up as soon as it is given a few cycles.

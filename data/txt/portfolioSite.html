<p>
  I built this portfolio site from "scratch" (to the extent that that's true of anything in web development)
  with the help of the very handy <a href="https://html5boilerplate.com">HTML5 Boilerplate</a>, plus
  jQuery for DOM manipulation, animations, and a couple AJAX requests.</p>
</p>
<p>
  One of those requests is sent to a PHP script I wrote to process a JSON file.
  The menu and slides here are generated at runtime from a few resources,
  making it easier and cleaner to add more later.</p>
</p>
<p>
  When looking at the source code,
  check out "data/screens.json" and "php/getScreens.php" in particular.
  As well as the loadScreens function in "js/main.js".
  The moveToScreen function is pretty fun too.

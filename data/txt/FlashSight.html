  I wrote this at the request of a teacher.
  One of her students was having trouble grasping patterns of words quickly,
  and she wanted something that might help him move past sounding out each individual syllable.

  The entire concept for this application is hers.
  We had a few conversations, discussed what she wanted it to do,
  and it was up to me to make it a reality.
  I thought of using something like React for this project,
  and Iâ€™m sure that would have worked.

  But, in the end, I decided it was overkill for the scope of something like this.
  So, I implemented my own little component system. Everything runs in a single page
  and the individual "screens" are generated in JavaScript files and added to the DOM
  via jQuery. I also used Bootstrap for the UI.

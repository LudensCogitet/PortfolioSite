<p>A self-taught programmer turning a life-long hobby into a career,
  I've worked with <b>HTML5</b>, <b>CSS3</b>, <b>Bootstrap</b>,
  <b>MaterializeCSS</b>, <b>JavaScript</b>, <b>jQuery</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>PHP</b>, and <b>Python</b>.
  Additionally, I have some history with <b>C++</b> and <b>C#</b>,
  and I'm always up for new languages, frameworks, and challenges.
</p>

<p>On the following slides you'll find descriptions of some of the things I've built.
  You'll also find links in the top right to <b>a live demonstration of the app described</b>,
  and to the project's GitHub repository where you can <b>take a look at the source</b>.
</p>

<p> I've done landscaping, carpentry, literary criticism, and games journalism,
  but solving problems and building solutions in code absorbs me like hardly anything else can.
  My focus is on designing and implementing all sorts of applications accessed through a browser --
  anything from educational tools for teaching reading and browser based games to database front and back ends --
  and I put a premium on elegance and ease of use.
</p>

<p>Additionally, having been a writer, as well as engaging in and leading literary seminars for many years,
  I'm an experienced communicator and a good listener;
  skills that cannot be underestimated when it comes to working with a team and clarifying project requirements.
